This document provides an in-depth technical overview of the Yemen Market Analysis project, detailing its econometric methodologies, data processing pipelines, and interactive visualization dashboard. The project employs advanced time series econometrics, spatial analysis techniques, and high-dimensional data visualization to analyze market dynamics, price transmission mechanisms, and the impact of conflict on commodity prices across different regions in Yemen. This comprehensive approach aims to provide policymakers and researchers with nuanced insights into the complex economic landscape of a fragile state.

## Data Sources and Preprocessing (1_Fetch_and_Prepare_Data.py)

### 1.1 Data Sources
- **World Food Programme (WFP) Food Prices data**: Monthly price data for 17 key commodities across multiple markets in Yemen.
- **Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) conflict data**: Geo-located conflict event data, including type of event and fatalities.
- **Yemen Population Estimates**: District-level population data for weighting and normalization.

### 1.2 Key Preprocessing Steps
- **Temporal alignment**:
    - Aggregation of daily ACLED data to monthly frequency to match WFP price data.
    - Handling of missing dates using forward-fill and backward-fill methods.
- **Conflict intensity index creation**:
    - Formula: CI = log(1 + Events) + log(1 + Fatalities)
    - Rationale: Logarithmic transformation to handle skewness and zero values.
- **Population-weighted conflict intensity**:
